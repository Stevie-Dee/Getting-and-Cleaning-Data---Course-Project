Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the files necessary to complete the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project available from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. Here are some tips on utilizing this data.

1. The main file is called run_analysis.R. This is the file that completes the 5 steps as required in the project. You will need to edit the file to set your working directory.
2. Step 5 creates a tidy data set called tidy_data.txt. This file contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3. CodeBook.md is a file that describes the original data and its source.
